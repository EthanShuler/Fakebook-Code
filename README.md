# Fakebook

The point of our app, Fakebook, is to purposefully create fake news. While this may seem entirely silly (and satire is a large part of our goal),
we also want to make the users of our website more aware of fake news in general. By using Fakebook, the users can see the trends in how fake
news is written, so they can better identify it on "real" websites.

A link to a working copy of the app can be found below, which is hosted on heroku.
